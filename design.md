# Minimalist

&copy; Terze 2020

## Purpose
Tracks possessions and promotes a minimalistic life by encouraging keeping a list of items owned as short as possible.

Because of the fact that the purpose is to minimize belongings and not dwell on possessions, items that are gone are permanently deleted. Well, at least as soon as the recycling bin is emptied.
